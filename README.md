# Order Independent Transparency with Imageblocks

This sample demonstrates and implementation of [multi layered alpha blending][1], an algorithm to achieve order independent transparency.

## Overview

This implementation takes advantage of the raster order group, tile shading, and imageblock APIs available in Metal with A11+ GPUs.
